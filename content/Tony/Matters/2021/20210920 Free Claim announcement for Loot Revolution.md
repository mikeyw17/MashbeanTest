## What is Loot Revolution (For Protesters)?

Loot Revolution is an attempt to take part in real world social activism from GameFi.

It unleashes the power of the metaverse, having in each episode a randomized representation of the 2019 Hong Kong Protest. All episodes and property metadata are fully available on-chain.

It is the first Loot Derivative that connects the dots from real world protests to decentralised RPG.

This RPG game based on Loot on blockchain was created against the backdrop of the Revolution of Our Times. Free NFTs of items and weapons having symbolic meanings throughout the Umbrella Movement and 2019 Protest will be issued.

1,000 items will be free issued, 10% value of each transaction will be collected automatically from the smart contract to support HK people.

Feel free to use them in any way.

## For Free

1,000 unique NFTs will start to be distributed by 23:00 (+8 GMT), airdrop questionnaire at the bottom of the article.

## For Freedom

We spent the whole week extracting symbols and meanings from arts, posters and all sorts of collections from the 2019 Hong Kong Protest. Within our collection now are 99 items, ranging from slogans, locations, objects with symbolic meanings. From there we categorized them into 8 groups and produced 1,000 NFTs subsequently.

The black and white image resembles the profile pictures on our social media at that time.

Adding another kick to our design is the warnings of violation to national security law held by police printed as watermarks on each image. Sharing the same spirit as the original Loot, feel free to use Loot Revolution in any way you want. It is in memorial to freedom of any kind.

## To Demo

We are uncertain of the form and the way these Loot Revolution NFTs will drift around the universe. We obviously hope Loot Revolution can contribute to the Loot RPG metaverse, already no dearth of great new ideas, but we also hope that it can inject some fresh flow of thoughts into the Loot community. When we were doing literature research on the Lennon Wall, we found that posters have already depicted the Protest as having elements of battling and hope. After all, this is already a tragic real life RPG, we are just refining from the mass in the reality into the essence in the virtual world.

## To Democracy

There’s also an intrinsic motivation in us to do something for the HK people. The basic rules of play of Loot Revolution are no different from common NFTs: we airdrop the 1,000 NFTs for free. If collectors want to circulate them at some point of the time, the embedded smart contract will allow us to collect 10% from each subsequent transaction in the secondary market. The royalties will be used to support organizations devoted to the Protest.
